Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. 
You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".

Example 3:
Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.

public:
    vector<string> stringMatching(vector<string>& words)
    {
         vector<string>ans;
        for(int i=0;i<words.size();i++)
           {
            for(int j=0;j<words.size();j++)
                {    
                
                if(i!=j && words[i].find(words[j]) != string::npos)
                    { //"If words[j] is found inside words[i], and they are not the same string, then do somethi"
                   ans.push_back(words[j]);  
                    }
                }
           }
         sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        ans.erase(unique(ans.begin(), ans.end()), ans.end());
      // unique(begin, end) Reorders vector so duplicates go to the end Returns iterator to new logical end
      //erase(it, end) Physically deletes elements in that range Shrinks vector size
        return ans;
    }
};
