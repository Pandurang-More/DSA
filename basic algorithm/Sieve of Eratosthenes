Explanation of Code (Sieve of Eratosthenes)

The program finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method.

Steps:

Create a boolean array isprime[101] and assume all numbers are prime initially (true).

Mark 0 and 1 as not prime (false).

Starting from p = 2, mark all multiples of p (like 2p, 3p, 4p...) as not prime.

We start marking from p * p because smaller multiples are already marked by smaller primes.

Repeat the process for all numbers up to √100.

Finally, print all numbers that are still marked true → these are the prime numbers.

Time Complexity:The sieve runs in O(N log log N), which is much faster than checking each number individually.
