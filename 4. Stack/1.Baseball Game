BASEBALL GAME (STACK SIMULATION)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules.

At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i]
is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of:

• Integer x → Record a new score of x  
• "+"       → Record sum of previous two scores  
• "D"       → Record double of previous score  
• "C"       → Remove the previous score  

Return the sum of all the scores after applying operations.


Example 1:
Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30


Example 2:
Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27


Example 3:
Input: ops = ["1","C"]
Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= operations.length <= 1000  
operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or integer string  
All operations are valid.



class Solution {
public:
    int calPoints(vector<string>& operations) {

        int record = 0;
        vector<int> st;

        for(string s : operations)
        {
            if(s == "C")
            {
                st.pop_back();
            }
            else if(s == "+")
            {
                int a = st.back();
                int b = st[st.size()-2];
                st.push_back(a + b);
            }
            else if(s == "D")
            {
                st.push_back(2 * st.back());
            }
            else
            {
                st.push_back(stoi(s));
            }
        }

        for(int i : st)
        {
            record += i;
        }

        return record;
    }
