#include <bits/stdc++.h>


int count = __builtin_popcount(n);  // count no of set bits

Gray code can be generated using the formula i ^ (i >> 1) which guarantees adjacent numbers differ by exactly one bit
Why Only One Bit Changes?

i >> 1 shifts bits to the right

XOR (^) flips only the bit that changes

Between consecutive i, only one bit differs

That’s why it forms a valid Gray Code sequence.
