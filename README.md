# ðŸ“š DSA Tracker â€“ Placement Preparation Journey

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms** practice code, organized topic-wise, to track my progress during placement preparation.  
Iâ€™ll be solving problems in C++ while focusing on improving problem-solving skills.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Strengthen fundamentals of **DSA**.
- Build consistency by solving problems daily.
- Prepare for coding rounds & technical interviews.

---

## ðŸ›  Languages & Tools

- **C++**
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Markdown for documentation

| Priority Level | Topics                                                                               | Comments                                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High           | Arrays, Strings, Sorting and Searching, Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees), Graphs, Matrices | Fundamental and frequent topics in most coding interviews                                   |
| Medium-High    | Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Heaps, Tries, Interval Problems          | Frequently asked, important for various problem types                                       |
| Medium         | Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Binary Operations, Geometry Problems                | More complex problem-solving, often asked in later rounds or advanced roles                 |
| Low            | Mathematical Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algorithms (e.g., Network Flows), Specialized Topics | Usually less frequent, specialized knowledge beneficial for higher level or niche roles     |
