Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order
is rotated between 1 and n times.

For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]  if rotated 4 times  
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]  if rotated 7 times  

Notice that rotating an array
[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in:
[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements,
return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Explanation:
The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Explanation:
The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] rotated 4 times.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11

Explanation:
The original array was [11,13,15,17] rotated 4 times.


Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All integers are unique.
Array is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) 
    {   
        int n = nums.size();
        int start = 0, end = n - 1;

        while (start < end)
        {
            while (start < end)
            {
                int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

                if (nums[mid] > nums[end])
                {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    end = mid;
                }
            }
        }

        return nums[end];
    }
};
