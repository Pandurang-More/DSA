Input: prices[] = [3, 2, 1, 4], k = 2
Output: [3, 7]
Explanation: As according to the offer if you buy one candy you can take at most k more for free. So in the first case, 
you buy the candy worth 1 and takes candies worth 3 and 4 for free, also you need to buy candy worth 2. So min cost: 1+2 = 3.
In the second case, you can buy the candy worth 4 and takes candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also you need to buy candy worth 3. So max cost: 3+4 = 7

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> minMaxCandy(vector<int>& prices, int k) {
        // Code here
        sort(prices.begin(),prices.end());   // sort to arrange the prices
        vector<int>ans;
        int start=0,end=prices.size()-1;
        int mincandy=0;
        int maxcandy=0;
        while(start <=end)                        // if want min candy then start from start 
        {
            mincandy+=prices[start];
            start++;
            end-=k;
        }
       
         start=0,end=prices.size()-1;          // it is necessary to reintialized.

        while(start<=end)                       // if want max then start from end
        {
            maxcandy+=prices[end];
            end--;
            start+=k;
        }
          ans.push_back(mincandy);
          ans.push_back(maxcandy);
          
          return ans;
    }
};
