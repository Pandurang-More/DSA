You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number 
is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".

Example 2:
Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the 
remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".

with sorting:
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s)
    {
        sort(s.rbegin(),s.rend());
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
        {
            if(s[i]=='0')
            {
            swap(s[i-1],s[s.size()-1]);
            break;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
};

without sorting:
class Solution
{
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s)
    { 
        int one=0,zero=0;
      for(char c:s)
      {
        if(c=='0')
        zero++;
        else
        one++;

      }

       one--; 

        string ans="";
        ans.append(one,'1');
        ans.append(zero,'0');
        ans.push_back('1'); 
      return ans;
    }
};
