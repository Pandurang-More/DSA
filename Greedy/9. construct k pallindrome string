Hint
Given a string s and an integer k, return true if you can use all the characters in s to construct non-empty
k palindrome strings or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "annabelle", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s.
Some possible constructions "anna" + "elble", "anbna" + "elle", "anellena" + "b"

Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of s.
Example 3:

Input: s = "true", k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: The only possible solution is to put each character in a separate string.



class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string s, int k)
    {
        int n = s.size();

        // If we have fewer characters than k strings → impossible
        if (n < k) return false;

        // If number of characters equals number of strings → each string gets 1 char
        if (n == k) return true;

        // Count how many characters have odd frequency
        int oddcount = 0;
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);

        // Frequency of each character
        for (char c : s)
            freq[c - 'a']++;

        // A palindrome requires at most 'k' odd-frequency chars
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
        {
            if (freq[i] % 2 == 1)
                oddcount++;
        }

        // If we have more odd-char groups than k palindromes → impossible
        return oddcount <= k;
    }
};


A palindrome can be formed if at most one character has an odd frequency (for one string).

But here we want to form k palindromes.
So the rule becomes:

🔹 Each palindrome can take at most 1 odd-frequency character as its center.

Therefore:

If a character has even frequency,
→ it can always be split and placed symmetrically (left-right) in any palindrome.
→ So even counts never cause problems.

If a character has odd frequency,
→ we must place one occurrence in the center of some palindrome.
→ So odd frequencies limit how many palindromes we need.

✅ Therefore:
✔ Only the number of odd-frequency characters matters.
