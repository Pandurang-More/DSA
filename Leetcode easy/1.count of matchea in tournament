Number of Matches in Tournament
====================================================

You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament
that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired
  with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and
  n / 2 teams advance to the next round.

- If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances,
  and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played,
  and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.

Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a
winner is decided.

----------------------------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: n = 7
Output: 6

Explanation:
1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, Advance = 4
2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, Advance = 2
3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, Winner
Total matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6

----------------------------------------------------
Example 2:
Input: n = 14
Output: 13

Explanation:
1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, Advance = 7
2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, Advance = 4
3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, Advance = 2
4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, Winner
Total matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13

----------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 200

   O(1) Solution
   ==================================================

   Explanation:
   - If one team plays, one team wins and one team loses → 1 match
   - If n teams play, one winner remains and (n - 1) teams lose
   - Therefore, total matches = n - 1
